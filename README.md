# Introduction




## Dataset provided.

You should receive the following files:
- `external-funds` that contains the funds data of instruments that you hold a position to.
- `master-reference-sql.sql` that contains the master reference data of the universe of instruments.


## Case Study

Assume your investment firm has started an investment strategy that invests its capital with 10 funds.

Every month each of the 10 fund sends over their end of month positions. This will include the instrument,price, market value and profit & loss information. The sample funds breakdown data `external-funds` is shared which contains the simulated data for:

- master reference data for bond and equity instruments including reference prices in open db format. You may wish to use any preferred db technology to import this reference data. A suggestion would be in sqlite.
- 10 Funds with 13 months of position change, price & market value data in csv format
- the names of the 10 funds are:

	- Whitestone
	- Wallington
	- Catalysm
	- Belaware
	- Gohen
	- Applebead
	- Magnum
	- Trustmind
	- Leeder
	- Virtous

## TODO

Please setup a sample database with your preferred database (eg. SQLite) which has the reference data setup and the csv data imported. Do ensure you are able to perform sample CRUD operation on these datasets. Feel free to go through the dataset to get familiarized.


## Useful Glossary/Tips

1. Position is the amount of a security, asset, or property that is owned (or sold short).

2. Market value is the term used to describe how much an asset or a company is worth on the financial market, according to market participants.

3. A fund is a pool of money set aside for a specific purpose.The pool of money in a fund is often invested and professionally managed in order to generate returns for its investors.

4. An instrument is an implement which is used to store or transfer value or financial obligations. A financial instrument is a tradable or negotiable asset, security, or contract.

5. Buying equity securities, or stocks, means you are buying a very small ownership stake in a company. While bonds/ Debt-based instruments are essentially loans made by an investor to the owner of the asset

6. Reference DB tables :
	a. Bond/Equity Prices - Table with price information for different instruments as of each applicable date
	b. Bond/Equity Reference - Table with all static information related to bond/equity Instruments


## Requirements

1. Code up a solution that could potentially be deployed, and describe the gaps/dependencies you will need work on to achieve a production version.

2. Attempt test-driven development to ensure that your solution is robust.

3. Generate a price reconciliation report that shows the difference between `the price on EOM date` from the reference data vs `the price` in the fund report. The report output should be in Excel. Please use python and leverage on data manipulation libraries like pandas/polars etc.
If the price is unavailable in reference db please use the last available price.
	a. show the break with instrument date ref price vs fund price.
	b. describe how can make it scalable for `N` number of fund reports in future

4. Based on your understanding of the data, attempt to create an Excel report which gives the best performing fund (highest raet of return) for every month. You can use the formula 
Rate of Return = (Fund_MV_end - Fund_MV_start + Realized P/L) / Fund_MV_start
Fund Market Value = Sum of (Symbol Market Value) for all symbols in that fund.
Fund Realized P/L = Sum of (Symbol Realized P/L) for the same monthly period.

## Setting Up the Environment

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd investment_etl
   ```
   
2. Install Poetry: If you don't have Poetry installed, you can install it using the following command:

bash
Copy code
```
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

Create a Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies:
```
poetry install
```
Set Up Environment Variables: Create a .env file in the root directory with the following content:

```
DATABASE_FILE=path/to/your/database.db
REFERENCE_SQL=path/to/your/master-reference-sql.sql
CSV_FOLDER=path/to/your/external_funds
```

## Running the ETL Process

To run the ETL process, execute the following command:

```
poetry run python -m src.etl
```

This command will load the CSV files from the specified folder, create or update the corresponding tables in the SQLite database, and generate the price reconciliation and performance reports.

### Running Tests

To run the unit tests, use the following command:

```
poetry run pytest tests/
```

This will execute all the tests in the `tests` directory and provide a report of the results.
